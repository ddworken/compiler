This directory should contain files to be run by the `input_file_test_suite` in test.ml.

Tests should come in groups of related files:
- someTest.fdl: the input program to be run
- someTest.valgrind: if present, run the program using valgrind
- someTest.err: the (optional) expected output of your program

The .err file's contents will be treated as a substring to check for: if the file is missing,
then this simply tests that the program either fails to compile or fails to run.
