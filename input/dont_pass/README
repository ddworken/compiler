This directory should contain files to be run by the `input_file_test_suite` in test.ml.

Tests should come in groups of related files:
- someTest.fdl: the input program to be run
- someTest.options: if present, options for compiling and running the program, one word per line
  options are
  * "valgrind" to run the program with valgrind,
  * "infer" to run type inference, and
  * "check" to run typechecking

This will test that the program is *supposed* to run, but currently does not.
(Ideally, when your compiler works perfectly, this directory should be empty.  For now, it's better
to document which test cases aren't working as expected.)
